          <p>Thanks for stopping by my blog! I'm your author, blogger, head chef, whatevs. I am Sarah, age 20 (soon to be 21, woot), graphic design student, ya know, the whole shebang. I go to Johnson and Wales in Providence Rhode Island. I work at a lovely store called SmartPak Saddlery, it's a pretty chill gig. During my free moments (which are few and far between, *help I'm drowing in work...*) I love to cook. I find it super relaxing and satisfying. It's super rewarding to get to make a meal and then enjoy all your hard work. Crazy instant reward. Baking is also a blast too, but I'm trying to live that *healthy* lifestyle now (or so I tell myself) and try not to have too many baked goods around anyways. I wanted to make this blog because I have tons of absolutely amazing recipes, some easy, some complex, that need to be shared with the world. Not enough people make soup in their everyday lives because they seem to think it's too much work for not enough payoff, but boy are they wrong. These recpes are all ~too~ good, you won't even believe it. I'll be real right now- I don't really like vegetables. Or healthy foods. Ok? I said it. But what I love about soup, is I can take a bunch of veggies, a bunch of really healthy ingredients, and make them taste amazing- i.e., they don't even taste like they're there. Crazy right? I hope you love all these recipes! If you do, let me know, and if not, you can like... go</p>
          <p>When I'm not going to school, working, or cooking, I do have some other super fun things I love. I compete in Dressage with my super duper amazing horse Kozo (seen below). Dressage is clearly the best sport ever, and don't fight me on that. I also do Pilates to get fit and improve my riding. I love going to the movies any chance I can get, I am too huge of a movie nerd. Netflix is also bae. When I have an extraordinary amount of free time, I love to read, but sadly I'm often too busy. I'm crossing my fingers that the summer will have some oppurtunites for that. I love to travel, but of course not as much as I'd like. I have 4 cats, all amazing, they are Hello Kitty, Little Pillows, Amber, and Thresh. We also take care of a feral cat named Bob. It's pretty wild.</p>
          <p>I hope y'all feel like you got to know me and my mission a little better! Keep on making souper soups!</p>
